# SDS Courses at Smith and Key Takeaways 

## SDS192 Introduction to Data Science

An introduction to data science using Python, R and SQL. Students learn how to scrape, process and clean data from the web; manipulate data in a variety of formats; contextualize variation in data; construct point and interval estimates using resampling techniques; visualize multidimensional data; design accurate, clear and appropriate data graphics; create data maps and perform basic spatial analysis; and query large relational databases. No prerequisites, but a willingness to write code is necessary.

On top of the goals of the above description, this semester you will:

* Equip yourselves with the data science tools necessarily to perform effective exploratory data analysis.
* Learn about project workflows such as: Getting a “minimally viable product” done quickly.
* Learn how to use internet search engines effectively in a data science setting.
* Data visualization: Grammar of Graphics, Five Named Graphs (5NG), color theory.
* Working with data: data wrangling, importing, and formatting
* Maps and spatial data: Maps and geospatial data.
* Learning how to learn new data science tools: SQL

## SDS220 Introduction to Statistics and Probability

An application-oriented introduction to modern statistical inference: study design, descriptive statistics; random variables; probability and sampling distributions; point and interval estimates; hypothesis tests, resampling procedures and multiple regression. A wide variety of applications from the natural and social sciences are used. Classes meet for lecture/discussion and for a required laboratory that emphasizes analysis of real data. SDS 220 satisfies the basic requirement for biological science, engineering, environmental science, neuroscience and psychology.

By the end of the course, statisticians (ie. you!) will be able to…

* Responsibly use sample data to learn about a larger population, using exploratory and inferential statistics - Create Statistics
* Detail the power and limitations of statistical concepts, and use this understanding to evaluate statistics from various contexts - Evaluate Statistics
* Explain the connection between probability and inferential statistics - Connect Statistical Concepts
* Work collaboratively, responsibly, and reflectively to create and present statistics to a wide variety of audiences - Communicate with Statistics

## SDS291 Multiple Regression

The principal objective of this course is to introduce the underlying theory and the practical problems that are encountered in using linear statistical models in real life situations. The main goal of this course is to learn the steps of the model building process including, understanding the nature of the dataset and deciding on the best type of regression model, estimating the regression coefficients and presenting the model, regression diagnostics and remedial measures, prediction, and inference. Depending on the variables of interest, this course is mainly focus on three types of regression models, simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and logistic regression. Although a perfect regression model cannot be expected as a result of an analysis when working with real-world data, the students will end up with the best model among many while learning the model selection procedures. The majority of the analysis will be done in R. Ultimately, the students will also use RMarkdown to prepare reports including all the calculations, plots and interpretations.

Student Learning Outcomes: After successfully completing this course the students should be able to:
* Use the exploratory data analytic techniques to suggest a model, fit the model and explain the theoretical properties and justifications for estimation and testing for the model.
* Carry out regression diagnostics to check the model assumptions.
* Remedial measures to achieve the model assumptions.
* Use the model selection techniques to choose the best and simplest model.
* Use logistic regression techniques to analyze data with binary response.
* Use the statistical software such as R to perform the analysis mentioned above.
* Prepare reports with RMarkdown.


## SDS237 Data Ethnography

Without rich documentation, quantitative data can strip away critical context needed to interpret values responsibly. This course introduces students to the theory and practice of data ethnography, demonstrating how qualitative data collection and analysis can be brought to bear on the study of data settings and artifacts. Through experiential exercises, students will learn techniques in field-note writing, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, documentary analysis, and archival research and how they may be used to contextualize the cultural underpinnings of datasets. Students will learn how to visualize datasets in ways that foreground their socio-political provenance in R. Students will also learn how ethnographic methods can be leveraged to improve data documentation and communication. The course will introduce debates regarding the politics of techno-scientific fieldwork.

Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:

* Recognize, interpret, and communicate the cultural underpinnings of data resources, infrastructures, and practices
* Define and engage principal methods of ethnography and communicate when and how they may be used in the study of data
* Strategically apply relevant ethnographic methods to the study of a data setting or artifact
* Produce data documentation and visualizations that account for the cultural contexts of data production, categorization, measurement, and use
