# SDS Courses at Smith and Key Takeaways 

## SDS192 Introduction to Data Science

An introduction to data science using Python, R and SQL. Students learn how to scrape, process and clean data from the web; manipulate data in a variety of formats; contextualize variation in data; construct point and interval estimates using resampling techniques; visualize multidimensional data; design accurate, clear and appropriate data graphics; create data maps and perform basic spatial analysis; and query large relational databases. No prerequisites, but a willingness to write code is necessary.

On top of the goals of the above description, this semester you will:

* Equip yourselves with the data science tools necessarily to perform effective exploratory data analysis.
* Learn about project workflows such as: Getting a “minimally viable product” done quickly.
* Learn how to use internet search engines effectively in a data science setting.
* Data visualization: Grammar of Graphics, Five Named Graphs (5NG), color theory.
* Working with data: data wrangling, importing, and formatting
* Maps and spatial data: Maps and geospatial data.
* Learning how to learn new data science tools: SQL

## SDS220 Introduction to Statistics and Probability

An application-oriented introduction to modern statistical inference: study design, descriptive statistics; random variables; probability and sampling distributions; point and interval estimates; hypothesis tests, resampling procedures and multiple regression. A wide variety of applications from the natural and social sciences are used. Classes meet for lecture/discussion and for a required laboratory that emphasizes analysis of real data. SDS 220 satisfies the basic requirement for biological science, engineering, environmental science, neuroscience and psychology.

By the end of the course, statisticians (ie. you!) will be able to…

* Responsibly use sample data to learn about a larger population, using exploratory and inferential statistics - Create Statistics
* Detail the power and limitations of statistical concepts, and use this understanding to evaluate statistics from various contexts - Evaluate Statistics
* Explain the connection between probability and inferential statistics - Connect Statistical Concepts
* Work collaboratively, responsibly, and reflectively to create and present statistics to a wide variety of audiences - Communicate with Statistics

## SDS237 Data Ethnography

Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:

* Recognize, interpret, and communicate the cultural underpinnings of data resources, infrastructures, and practices
* Define and engage principal methods of ethnography and communicate when and how they may be used in the study of data
* Strategically apply relevant ethnographic methods to the study of a data setting or artifact
* Produce data documentation and visualizations that account for the cultural contexts of data production, categorization, measurement, and use
